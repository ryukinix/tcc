Image segmentation is a technique that breaks a image into regions of
interest, such as objects from a landscape. Image segmentation
algorithms have variations in their type of learning, such as
unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. Complex networks are
graphs with unstructured trivial objects used to represent certain
domains, such as regions of an image and their surroundings.

In this work, an image segmentation algorithm
semi-supervised is proposed combining superpixel,
complex networks and collective dynamics.
