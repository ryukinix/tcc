Image segmentation is a technique that divides the image into regions
of interest, such as objects in a landscape. Image segmentation
algorithms present variations in their types of learning, including
unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. In the context of
interactive segmentation, the challenge is to segment objects from the
background with the help of initial labels provided by a
user. Superpixels are unsupervised segmentation algorithms used as
pre-segmentation for various image problems, such as classification
and segmentation. Complex networks are graphs with non-trivial
structures used to represent certain data domains, such as regions of
an image and their neighborhoods. Collective dynamics in a complex
network refer to the emergent and interactive behavior of various
elements or actors within an interconnected and complex network, where
the actions of one element can influence the actions of others. In
this work, we propose a semi-supervised image segmentation algorithm
that combines the techniques of superpixels, complex networks, and
collective dynamics. The method is evaluated under various conditions
through an interactive segmentation scenario.
